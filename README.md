i deleted running two servers and now i created a middleware to help me to edit the request going to login and refresh token and it is called oauth.



my method is using password grant client but it is apparently discouraged and especially for 2 factor authentication in the future so i should
refactor my code to use authorization code grant apparently in the future

check why the scheduler in kernel is not working i had it set up to delete old tokens but it is not working
